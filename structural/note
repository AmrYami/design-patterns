facade example like what i did in media lib that we have sub-system do alot
of things so we need to make facade to implement this lib and what we
 need from this lib to make our system work with it.
 facade vs adapterWrapper
 facade to implement what we need from sub-system or lib and our system will
 work with facade not with lib or sub-system.
 adapterWrapper to make two interfaces not return the same types work
 with eachother and our system will work with this adapter.
